# ViginereCipher
This is a project from my Cyber Security class where we had to create something known as a Viginere Cipher in C. Must be ran with arguments via command line.

Fundamentally, it takes a message and a key from a file. It then prints a cipher by adding the value of each letter of the text to the letter of the key via Modulus 26.
That value is the value of the character to be printed producing the cipher.

I have also added some plaintext and key files given to us to test the code. Feel free to run it with those.
